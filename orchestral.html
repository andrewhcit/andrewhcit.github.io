<p>This is a selection of pieces that Alfie might enjoy listening to. I've included most of the iconic pieces in the classical repertoire and most of the pieces used in popular cartoons or other pop culture (as long as they seem enjoyable throughout for someone new to classical music), added a few personal favorites and other pieces I think are accessible, and tried to sprinkle in some diversity in composers because I don't want it to be limited to dead white men from just six European countries.</p>
<p>I decided to select videos that show the musicians in live performance as long as I could find at least one with both reasonable performance quality and audiovisual recording quality. I considered recording quality at least as important as performance quality in selecting videos; I also tried to limit the amount of non-musical material in the videos (e.g. generally avoiding videos that include over 90 seconds of applause at the end).</p>

<li>Yes, this is being played by a “baroque” orchestra, but it would be more accurate to call Apollo's Fire a period instrument orchestra. String players switched from the baroque bow to the modern Tourte bow beginning in the 1760s, but the instruments remained the same for some time longer. The A to which musicians tuned began to rise in the late 18th century, the chin rest was introduced in the early 19th century, and the shoulder rest appeared later still.</li>
