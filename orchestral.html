<p>This is a selection of pieces that Alfie might enjoy listening to. I've included most of the iconic pieces in the classical repertoire and most of the pieces used in popular cartoons or other pop culture (as long as they seem enjoyable throughout for someone new to classical music), added a few personal favorites and other pieces I think are accessible, and tried to sprinkle in some diversity in composers because I don't want it to be limited to dead white men from just six European countries.</p>
<p>I decided to select videos that show the musicians in live performance as long as I could find at least one with both reasonable performance quality and audiovisual recording quality. I considered recording quality at least as important as performance quality in selecting videos; I also tried to limit the amount of non-musical material in the videos (e.g. generally avoiding videos that include over 90 seconds of applause at the end).</p>

<ul>
<li>Yes, this is being played by a “baroque” orchestra, but it would be more accurate to call Apollo's Fire a period instrument orchestra. String players switched from the baroque bow to the modern Tourte bow beginning in the 1760s, but the instruments remained the same for some time longer. The A to which musicians tuned began to rise in the late 18th century, the chin rest was introduced in the early 19th century, and the shoulder rest appeared later still.</li>

<li>Beethoven's three Leonore Overtures were all draft overtures intended for his only opera <i>Fidelio</i>, whose working title was <i>Leonore</i>. All three were discarded but were eventually published separately. Leonore Overture No. 3 is the most popular of the four overtures for stand-alone performances in the concert hall – Beethoven ended up rejecting it because he was afraid it would overshadow the opera itself!</li>

<ul>
<li>Although the opera is not often performed outside Russia, its overture is famous as an orchestral showpiece, frequently used to display the virtuosity of an orchestra's string sections.</li>
<li>The conductor of this performance, Valery Gergiev, famously (or infamously) tended to lose batons early in his conducting career as he would lose his grip and accidentally throw them in the air while conducting vigorously. From his early 30s onward, he has usually used a toothpick as a baton.</li>

<ul>
<li>Before steam engines became commonplace, a calm sea was not a good thing! This piece, inspired by a pair of Goethe poems, takes the listener from the anxiety of the becalmed sailor to relief as the wind picks up, and reaches its destination.</li>

<p>Otto Nicolai (1810-1849, Germany) – Overture to <i>The Merry Wives of Windsor</i><br>
Victoria Symphony Orchestra / Darryl One<br>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F9ZuBKDCzY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F9ZuBKDCzY</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Nicolai was a well-known conductor, and is best known as the Vienna Philharmonic's first-ever conductor. However, his opera <i>The Merry Wives of Windsor</i> was his first and last major success as a composer; he died suddenly of a stroke two months after its premiere. It turns out he could have gotten his big break earlier, but ended up becoming a footnote in opera history instead: in 1841 he turned down an opera libretto that was then offered to a then-unknown Giuseppe Verdi and became <i>Nabucco</i>, the opera that first made Verdi famous.</li>

<li>I'm reluctant to include this because it's the traditional finals week wake-up call at Caltech. It's also a Caltech tradition that anyone who plays it outside finals week, except when marathoning the entire Ring Cycle, gets thrown into the nearest pond. But it's also an iconic piece, so it's included here.</li>

<ul>
<li>Offenbach's comic opera <i>Orphée aux enfers</i> (Orpheus in the Underworld) is an irreverent, satirical take on the Orpheus story that skewers Gluck's opera <i>Orfeo ed Euridice</i>, stilted performances of classical drama, and various society and political scandals of the day. Today, it is best known outside classical circles as the origin of the “can-can,” which occurs in the second act of the opera and is also heard near the end of the overture.</li>

<ul>
<li>Borodin left his opera <i>Prince Igor</i> unfinished when he suddenly and unexpectedly died of a ruptured aortic aneurysm, and it was completed using his notes by his colleagues Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov and Alexander Glazunov. The overture is one of the greatest feats of musical memory in Western music history, as Borodin had it fully formed in his mind but had written down only a small portion of it. Two weeks before his death, Borodin had informally presented the overture to Rimsky-Korsakov and Glazunov for feedback, playing it on the piano and stopping at many points to describe the orchestration. At the time, of course, neither of the guests would have had any reason to consciously try to remember the overture, and neither heard the overture again after that day – and yet Glazunov reconstructed it in its entirety, his reconstruction being consistent with all the parts that Rimsky-Korsakov remembered.</li>
<li>Rimsky-Korsakov and Glazunov did most of the work to complete the opera at Borodin's kitchen table, with the constant distraction of the deceased composer's six cats.</li>

<ul>
<li>This was Brahms's famous musical joke. Brahms was nominated for an honorary doctorate at the University of Breslau, and accepted it, thinking he would not have to do more than give a few remarks on the occasion. Upon learning that he was expected to compose a piece of music for the occasion, Brahms decided to take a jab at the university by composing an overture based on student drinking songs that were popular at the time.</li>
<li>Elmer Bernstein used this piece for his own musical joke in the soundtrack of <i>Animal House</i>: some of the music heard during the title sequence is taken from the Academic Festival Overture, with the same orchestration and only slight changes to the notes. Ironically, the statue of the college's founder appears on screen to the backdrop of an orchestrated drinking song!</li>

<ul>
<li>It turns out the theme was not by Haydn at all! Brahms was intrigued after finding a piece titled “Chorale St. Antoni,” which unbeknownst to Brahms was spuriously attributed to Haydn by the publisher. Accordingly, some recordings and concert programs now refer to the piece as the “St. Anthony Variations.”</li>

<li>I've picked a performance that uses muskets instead of cannons, so as to avoid excessively frightening the cats – but this might be closer to what Tchaikovsky heard! Because it was virtually impossible in the 19th century to time the cannon shots with enough precision, it wasn't until 1967 that cannons were actually used in a performance. All the documented performances before then used either small arms, simulated cannon fire, or recorded cannon sounds.</li>

<li><i>Capriccio Italien</i> was Tchaikovsky's musical travelogue of a vacation in Rome during Carnival. It follows his visit in extremely literal detail, beginning with a bugle call because he stayed at a hotel next door to a military barracks! The rest of the music, though, is mostly inspired by street bands Tchaikovsky heard.</li>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE0RbPsC9uE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE0RbPsC9uE</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Sibelius composed <i>Finlandia</i> in 1899 to be played at a gala in Helsinki that was ostensibly to raise money for newspaper pension funds, but also meant to rally support for a free press in Finland, which was then occupied by the Russian Empire. The piece was originally for orchestra alone; lyrics were written for the hymn-like final section in 1941 with the composer's approval. <i>Finlandia</i> is performed both with and without chorus today.</li>
<li>The “Finlandia hymn” melody took a life of its own outside of the piece. It has been used for at least seven Christian hymns and three university alma maters, a Welsh patriotic song, and the national anthem of the short-lived African state of Biafra.</li>

<li>The ballet <i>The Prodigal Son</i> was Alfven's final composition. He completely ceased composing in 1942, at the age of 70, but in 1956 he was persuaded to come out of retirement briefly and compose a ballet for a gala commemorating his own 85th birthday.</li>

<ul>
<li>This was the first piece by an Afro-British composer to be played by a major orchestra. Upon its second performance, which took place in New York, it earned Coleridge-Taylor the nickname “the African Mahler.”</li>
<li>You may notice the principal violist in this orchestra playing an unusually-shaped instrument. This is an Iizuka-pattern viola. Developed in the 1970s by a maker named Hiroshi Iizuka, it is one of a number of unusual viola shapes designed in the last century to make larger violas playable by smaller violists. In Iizuka-pattern violas, the narrow, roughly arrow-shaped upper bout allows the violist's hand to reach higher up the fingerboard without being blocked by the body of the instrument.</li>

<ul>
<li>Milhaud spent two years in Rio de Janeiro as a secretary at the French embassy. For the rest of his life he often drew inspiration from the popular music he had heard there. He composed Le Boeuf sur le Toit in 1920, a year after returning from Brazil. It was originally intended to be the score for a silent Charlie Chaplin film, but when the film was canceled it became a “Cinema Symphony on South American Airs” and then a ballet (“pantomime farce”) set in a Brazilian bar. The piece takes its title from one of the melodies heard in it, a Carnaval tune whose title Milhaud simply translated into French. Years later, a cabaret named after this piece became famous as a gathering place for avant-garde artists.</li>

<p>Lili Boulanger (1893-1918, France) – D'un matin de printemps<br>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4JeeXilFKo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4JeeXilFKo</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Lili Boulanger was the first woman to win the prestigious Prix de Rome for composition, but her career was cut short by her death from tuberculosis at the age of 24. Her symphonic poem <i>D'un matin de printemps</i> was the second-last piece she completed.</li>
<li>Lili Boulanger's death may have indirectly created a whole generation of American composers. After she died, her older sister Nadia, also a talented composer, ceased composing and devoted herself entirely to teaching. At the time, there was still a great stigma surrounding American classical musicians in Europe, and Nadia Boulanger was one of the few highly-regarded composition teachers who routinely accepted American students. Her students included a virtual who's-who of American composers active between 1920 and 1970. (Six Degrees of Nadia Boulanger is a thing among American classical musicians today.)</li>

<ul>
<li>Gershwin made two trips to Paris in the 1920s to attempt to study there. The first time, in 1926, Maurice Ravel said he could not teach Gershwin, saying, “Why be a second-rate Ravel when you can be a first-rate Gershwin?” The second time, in 1928, he approached Nadia Boulanger only to be turned down again, Boulanger asking him: “What could I give you that you haven't already got?” But Gershwin did not leave Paris entirely empty-handed. He began composing An American in Paris, a symphonic poem portraying the impressions of an American visitor in the city, during his first trip, and completed it shortly after returning from his second trip. For the premiere in New York, Gershwin even purchased and brought home four Parisian taxi horns.</li>
<li>Long after Gershwin's death, the musical film <i>An American in Paris</i> was written around Gershwin's music, concluding with an elaborate dance sequence that used the symphonic poem of the same title.</li>

<ul>
<li>Copland's aim in writing this symphonic poem was not to present “Mexican” music, but to evoke the atmosphere of a particular dance hall in Mexico City. He made several visits to Mexico in the 1930s, and on one of these visits his friend and colleague Carlos Chávez took him to El Salón México. The melodies are derived from popular songs for which Copland purchased sheet music in Mexico City.</li>

<li>Shostakovich was repeatedly denounced by the Stalin regime for his modernism, and for much of his career he was in such fear of arrest that he kept a packed suitcase under his desk at all times in case he had to flee. He wrote the Festive Overture in just three days, shortly after Stalin's death, and when he conducted it himself it was his first appearance on a concert stage in decades. Not coincidentally, it is one of his few happy-sounding pieces; he was quite clearly dancing on Stalin's grave.</li>
