<p>This is a selection of pieces that Alfie might enjoy listening to. I've included most of the iconic pieces in the classical repertoire and most of the pieces used in popular cartoons or other pop culture (as long as they seem enjoyable throughout for someone new to classical music), added a few personal favorites and other pieces I think are accessible (i.e. can be enjoyed purely as a listening experience without much musical knowledge), and tried to sprinkle in some diversity in composers because I don't want it to be limited to dead white men from six European countries.</p>
<p>I decided to select videos that show the musicians in live performance as long as I could find at least one with both reasonable performance quality and audiovisual recording quality. I considered recording quality at least as important as performance quality in selecting videos; I also tried to limit the amount of non-musical material in the videos (e.g. generally avoiding videos that include over 90 seconds of applause at the end).</p>

<li>This performance is conducted the way Lully would have conducted, by beating time on the floor with a heavy staff.</li>
<li>Lully famously died because of how he conducted. He struck his foot with the staff while conducting, and the wound developed gangrene which killed him.</li>

<ul>
<li>Yes, this is being played by a “baroque” orchestra, but it would be more accurate to call Apollo's Fire a period instrument orchestra. String players switched from the baroque bow to the modern Tourte bow beginning in the 1760s, but the instruments remained the same for some time longer. The A to which musicians tuned began to rise in the late 18th century, the chin rest was introduced in the early 19th century, and the shoulder rest appeared later still.</li>

<ul>
<li>Beethoven's three Leonore Overtures were all draft overtures intended for his only opera <i>Fidelio</i>, whose working title was <i>Leonore</i>. All three were discarded but were eventually published separately. Leonore Overture No. 3 is the most popular of the four overtures for stand-alone performances in the concert hall – Beethoven ended up rejecting it because he was afraid it would overshadow the opera itself!</li>

<li>No, the title of the video isn't an error! Schubert originally composed this overture for a different play, <i>Die Zauberharfe</i>, then repurposed it for <i>Rosamunde</i> when the production of the other play fell apart.</li>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nyx99YcHdIQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nyx99YcHdIQ</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Although the opera is not often performed outside Russia, its overture is famous as an orchestral showpiece, frequently used to display the virtuosity of an orchestra's string sections.</li>
<li>The conductor of this performance, Valery Gergiev, famously (or infamously) tended to lose batons early in his conducting career as he would lose his grip and accidentally throw them in the air while conducting vigorously. From his early 30s onward, he has usually used a toothpick as a baton.</li>

<ul>
<li>Before steam engines became commonplace, a calm sea was not a good thing! This piece, inspired by a pair of Goethe poems, takes the listener from the anxiety of the becalmed sailor to relief as the wind picks up, and reaches its destination.</li>

<p>Otto Nicolai (1810-1849, Germany) – Overture to <i>The Merry Wives of Windsor</i><br>
Victoria Symphony Orchestra / Darryl One<br>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F9ZuBKDCzY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F9ZuBKDCzY</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Nicolai was a well-known conductor, and is best known as the Vienna Philharmonic's first-ever conductor. However, his opera <i>The Merry Wives of Windsor</i> was his first and last major success as a composer; he died suddenly of a stroke two months after its premiere. It turns out he could have gotten his big break earlier, but ended up becoming a footnote in opera history instead: in 1841 he turned down an opera libretto that was then offered to a then-unknown Giuseppe Verdi and became <i>Nabucco</i>, the opera that first made Verdi famous.</li>

<li>I'm reluctant to include this because it's the traditional finals week wake-up call at Caltech. It's also a Caltech tradition that anyone who plays it outside finals week, except when marathoning the entire Ring Cycle, gets thrown into the nearest pond. But it's also an iconic piece, so it's included here.</li>

<ul>
<li>Offenbach's comic opera <i>Orphée aux enfers</i> (Orpheus in the Underworld) is an irreverent, satirical take on the Orpheus story that skewers Gluck's opera <i>Orfeo ed Euridice</i>, stilted performances of classical drama, and various society and political scandals of the day. Today, it is best known outside classical circles as the origin of the “can-can,” which occurs in the second act of the opera and is also heard near the end of the overture.</li>

<ul>
<li>Borodin left his opera <i>Prince Igor</i> unfinished when he suddenly and unexpectedly died of a ruptured aortic aneurysm, and it was completed using his notes by his colleagues Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov and Alexander Glazunov. The overture is one of the greatest feats of musical memory in Western music history, as Borodin had it fully formed in his mind but had written down only a small portion of it. Two weeks before his death, Borodin had informally presented the overture to Rimsky-Korsakov and Glazunov for feedback, playing it on the piano and stopping at many points to describe the orchestration. At the time, of course, neither of the guests would have had any reason to consciously try to remember the overture, and neither heard the overture again after that day – and yet Glazunov reconstructed it in its entirety, his reconstruction being consistent with all the parts that Rimsky-Korsakov remembered.</li>
<li>Rimsky-Korsakov and Glazunov did most of the work to complete the opera at Borodin's kitchen table, with the constant distraction of the deceased composer's six cats.</li>

<ul>
<li>This was Brahms's famous musical joke. Brahms was nominated for an honorary doctorate at the University of Breslau, and accepted it, thinking he would not have to do more than give a few remarks on the occasion. Upon learning that he was expected to compose a piece of music for the occasion, Brahms decided to take a jab at the university by composing an overture based on student drinking songs that were popular at the time.</li>
<li>Elmer Bernstein used this piece for his own musical joke in the soundtrack of <i>Animal House</i>: some of the music heard during the title sequence is taken from the Academic Festival Overture, with the same orchestration and only slight changes to the notes. Ironically, the statue of the college's founder appears on screen to the backdrop of an orchestrated drinking song!</li>

<li>It turns out the theme was not by Haydn at all! Brahms was intrigued after finding a piece titled “Chorale St. Antoni,” which unbeknownst to Brahms was spuriously attributed to Haydn by the publisher. Accordingly, some recordings and concert programs now refer to the piece as the “St. Anthony Variations.”</li>

<li>I've picked a performance that uses muskets instead of cannons, so as to avoid excessively frightening the cats – but this might be closer to what Tchaikovsky heard! Because it was virtually impossible in the 19th century to time the cannon shots with enough precision, it wasn't until 1967 that cannons were actually used in a performance. All the documented performances before then used either small arms, simulated cannon fire, or recorded cannon sounds.</li>

<li><i>Capriccio Italien</i> was Tchaikovsky's musical travelogue of a vacation in Rome during Carnival. It follows his visit in extremely literal detail, beginning with a bugle call because he stayed at a hotel next door to a military barracks! The rest of the music, though, is mostly inspired by street bands Tchaikovsky heard.</li>

<ul>
<li>Sibelius composed <i>Finlandia</i> in 1899 to be played at a gala in Helsinki that was ostensibly to raise money for newspaper pension funds, but also meant to rally support for a free press in Finland, which was then occupied by the Russian Empire. The piece was originally for orchestra alone; lyrics were written for the hymn-like final section in 1941 with the composer's approval. <i>Finlandia</i> is performed both with and without chorus today.</li>
<li>The “Finlandia hymn” melody took a life of its own outside of the piece. It has been used for at least seven Christian hymns and three university alma maters, a Welsh patriotic song, and the national anthem of the short-lived African state of Biafra.</li>

<ul>
<li>This was the first piece by an Afro-British composer to be played by a major orchestra. Upon its second performance, which took place in New York, it earned Coleridge-Taylor the nickname “the African Mahler.”</li>
<li>You may notice the principal violist in this orchestra playing an unusually-shaped instrument. This is an Iizuka-pattern viola. Developed in the 1970s by a maker named Hiroshi Iizuka, it is one of a number of unusual viola shapes designed in the last century to make larger violas playable by smaller violists. In Iizuka-pattern violas, the narrow, roughly arrow-shaped upper bout allows the violist's hand to reach higher up the fingerboard without being blocked by the body of the instrument.</li>

<ul>
<li>Milhaud spent two years in Rio de Janeiro as a secretary at the French embassy. For the rest of his life he often drew inspiration from the popular music he had heard there. He composed Le Boeuf sur le Toit in 1920, a year after returning from Brazil. It was originally intended to be the score for a silent Charlie Chaplin film, but when the film was canceled it became a “Cinema Symphony on South American Airs” and then a ballet (“pantomime farce”) set in a Brazilian bar. The piece takes its title from one of the melodies heard in it, a Carnaval tune whose title Milhaud simply translated into French. Years later, a cabaret named after this piece became famous as a gathering place for avant-garde artists.</li>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4JeeXilFKo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4JeeXilFKo</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Lili Boulanger was the first woman to win the prestigious Prix de Rome for composition, but her career was cut short by her death from tuberculosis at the age of 24. Her symphonic poem <i>D'un matin de printemps</i> was the second-last piece she completed.</li>
<li>Lili Boulanger's death may have indirectly created a whole generation of American composers. After she died, her older sister Nadia, also a talented composer, ceased composing and devoted herself entirely to teaching. At the time, there was still a great stigma surrounding American classical musicians in Europe, and Nadia Boulanger was one of the few highly-regarded composition teachers who routinely accepted American students. Her students included a virtual who's-who of American composers active between 1920 and 1970. (Six Degrees of Nadia Boulanger is a thing among American classical musicians today.)</li>

<ul>
<li>Gershwin made two trips to Paris in the 1920s to attempt to study there. The first time, in 1926, Maurice Ravel said he could not teach Gershwin, saying, “Why be a second-rate Ravel when you can be a first-rate Gershwin?” The second time, in 1928, he approached Nadia Boulanger only to be turned down again, Boulanger asking him: “What could I give you that you haven't already got?” But Gershwin did not leave Paris entirely empty-handed. He began composing An American in Paris, a symphonic poem portraying the impressions of an American visitor in the city, during his first trip, and completed it shortly after returning from his second trip. For the premiere in New York, Gershwin even purchased and brought home four Parisian taxi horns.</li>
<li>Long after Gershwin's death, the musical film <i>An American in Paris</i> was written around Gershwin's music, concluding with an elaborate dance sequence that used the symphonic poem of the same title.</li>

<li>Copland's aim in writing this symphonic poem was not to present “Mexican” music, but to evoke the atmosphere of a particular dance hall in Mexico City. He made several visits to Mexico in the 1930s, and on one of these visits his friend and colleague Carlos Chávez took him to El Salón México. The melodies are derived from popular songs for which Copland purchased sheet music in Mexico City.</li>

<li>Shostakovich was repeatedly denounced by the Stalin regime for his modernism, and for much of his career he was in such fear of arrest that he kept a packed suitcase under his desk at all times in case he had to flee. He wrote the Festive Overture in just three days, shortly after Stalin's death, and when he conducted it himself it was his first appearance on a concert stage in decades. Not coincidentally, it is one of his few happy-sounding pieces; he was quite clearly dancing on Stalin's grave.</li>

<li>The second movement of this suite is the source material for the “Air on the G string” attributed to Bach. The “Air on the G string” is not Bach's original version, but a 19th-century arrangement by August Wilhelmj that transposes the melody to a different key and an octave lower so that it can be played entirely on the G string, the violin's lowest string.</li>

<li>By 1749, when he composed this suite, Handel was so popular in London that, when it was announced that tickets would be sold for the dress rehearsal, an audience of over 12,000 people attended the rehearsal, causing a three-hour traffic jam on London Bridge.</li>
<li>In contrast to the music, the royal fireworks display was disastrous. Rain caused many misfires, a pavilion burned down in the middle of the show, and stray rockets injured at least five people.</li>

<ul>
<li>As a virtuoso pianist, Gottschalk was the first musician from the New World to become famous in Europe. As a composer, he was seen mostly as a curiosity. He was the first composer in the European tradition to draw extensively from Latin American popular music. The first movement depicts a tropical sunset with storm; the second movement portrays a Latin American dance party and contains what is probably the earliest use of a samba rhythm in orchestral music. This piece was performed once in Havana in 1859, and not heard again until 1955, possibly because it was so far ahead of its time!</li>

<li>Each of the variations represents a reminiscence of a person close to Elgar. The identities of all the people described in the music are known; that is not the “enigma.” Elgar stated in interviews that the theme is a counterpoint to a well-known melody that is not heard at any time in the piece. Elgar rejected every solution that was proposed during his life – to one guess he replied, “Of course not, but it is so well-known that it is extraordinary no-one has found it.”</li>
<li>The ninth variation “Nimrod” (11:48 of this video) has become popular on its own and is frequently used at funerals and memorial services.</li>

While studying in Europe, he lived in Edvard Grieg's house, and it was Grieg who encouraged him to explore his own country's folk music. When he composed his <i>Serie Brasileira</i>, the influence of Brazilian popular music in the piece was considered scandalous by the conservative Brazilian musical establishment of the era.</li>

<ul>
<li>Holst was a school music teacher for almost three decades, so it should not be surprising that many of his compositions were intended for high school ensembles. St. Paul's Suite is perhaps the best-known of his school orchestra compositions. This folk-inspired piece was composed in 1913 for the inauguration of a new music wing at St. Paul's Girls' School, one of the three schools where he taught.</li>
<li>Holst's most famous piece, <i>The Planets</i>, was atypical for him. Most of his music, whether intended for students or professionals, drew on British folk music for its inspiration.</li>

<li>This is one of two concert suites based on English folk songs that Holst composed for the Royal Military School of Music. Holst later re-scored the fourth movement for strings and used it in his <i>St. Paul's Suite</i>.</li>
<li>The Hobbit theme in Howard Shore's score for <i>Lord of the Rings</i>, which sounds similar to a theme in the first movement of this piece, is derived from the same source material. Both are loosely based on the Welsh folk song “Swansea Town.”</li>

<li>A Frenchman of Afro-Caribbean descent, Joseph Bologne first became famous as a fencer, was knighted and made an officer in the royal bodyguard, and was thenceforth known as the Chevalier de Saint-Georges. There was somewhat of a sensation in Paris society when the celebrated fencing master was seen playing violin in one of the city's leading orchestras, and eventually performing as concertmaster and then as a violin soloist. At one point his name was put forward to be director of the Paris Opera, but withdrawn when some of the singers refused to work for a black man.</li>
<li>St.-Georges was surprisingly central in Euroean art music in his day. As a violinist, he may have been more responsible than anyone else for popularizing the new Tourte-style bow that replaced the baroque bow and remains standard today. As the director of the Orchestre Olympique in the 1780s, he commissioned six of Haydn's symphonies. He and Mozart became enemies after he rejected Mozart's “Paris” Symphony and Mozart had to resort to having it played by a less prestigious orchestra.</li>
<li>St.-Georges was also partially responsible for Alexandre Dumas being born in France. Having decided to serve the Revolution, he recruited a regiment of volunteers from France's Caribbean colonies. One of his recruits was Thomas-Alexandre Dumas, who would later be the first black general in a Western army and father of the famous writer.</li>

<li>Beethoven's only violin concerto was not an instant hit. It was performed just once in his lifetime, disastrously, and for decades violinists ignored it because it was deemed “unplayable.” It then became a staple of the repertoire almost overnight in 1844, when 12-year-old violin prodigy Joseph Joachim (arguably the world's leading violinist in the second half of the 19th century) gave a masterful performance in London. It appears that no one had bothered to attempt the Beethoven concerto in the interim, simply taking as accepted wisdom that the concerto was unplayable, even though the standard of string playing had gone up significantly since Beethoven's day.</li>

<ul>
<li>Composed in 1877, this concerto was the single most popular piano concerto in Europe in the 1880s and 1890s before abruptly falling out of favor and into obscurity.</li>
<li>At one point, Hans von Bülow, one of Europe's leading conductors, named Rheinberger as one of the five composers then alive who would be remembered forever. (The other four: Brahms, Tchaikovsky, Saint-Saens, and Raff.) That prediction was not quite accurate. Rheinberger remains well-known as a choral and organ composer, and as the teacher of a number of significant composers and conductors including Richard Strauss, but is not generally considered to be a major composer. Still, he probably remains the most famous person ever born in Liechtenstein!</li>

<ul>
<li>An apocryphal story has it that Chaminade wrote the Concertino as a wedding gift for a flute-playing erstwhile lover after he left her to marry someone else, and tried to make it so fiendishly difficult that he would be unable to play it (though he supposedly did manage). According to the story, some months later she received a thank-you note from the flautist's mother-in-law – and on the back of the note was a death threat. The story is probably not true; Chaminade had herself married a year before she composed the piece, and the first performance of the Concertino was by a female friend.</il>
<li>What is true: the Chaminade Flute Concertino is one of only a handful of pieces composed by women to enter the standard repertoire. In fact, it is the only piece composed by a woman before 1950 that is played with any regularity by US orchestras.</li>

<li>Paul Wittgenstein, the older brother of philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein, was an emerging piano virtuoso when the First World War broke out and he was drafted into the army. He was shot in the elbow and his right arm had to be amputated. After the war, he wrote to several composers asking them to write material for him to perform with his left hand alone. As his story spread, so many composers were inspired to write music for him that he singlehandedly (!) created a whole genre of piano music. This concerto by Ravel is the best-known of the pieces composed for him.</li>

<li>After arriving in America in 1934 as a Jew fleeing Nazi persecution, Korngold went to work in Hollywood, and was the first composer to become a celebrity for his film scores. In 1947, disillusioned with the film industry, he retired from composing film scores in order to concentrate on music for the concert hall. His Violin Concerto was only the second piece he produced after making that decision. Korngold never entirely left Hollywood behind, however. Many of his later concert works allude to his own film scores, and this concerto was no exception. The main themes of all three movements are at least loosely based on melodies Korngold wrote for four different films.</li>

Each of the four movements includes quotations from a Vivaldi concerto – but because Buenos Aires is in the Southern Hemisphere, the seasons are inverted. For example, “Verano Porteño” (Buenos Aires Summer) includes quotations from Vivaldi's “Winter.”</li>

<li>The Butterfly Lovers Violin Concerto is the most-performed piece of orchestral music by any Asian composer and has been especially popular for use in figure skating competitions. It took about two decades after its 1959 composition to become popular, mostly because it was suppressed during the Cultural Revolution.</li>
<li>Rather than the traditional concerto form, this concerto is in a single movement with a number of distinct sections that follow the Chinese legend of the Butterfly Lovers. Though composed for the Western violin, it is sometimes played on erhu today.</li>
<li>You may recognize some of the musicians in this video as members of the Camellia Symphony Orchestra. Folsom Lake Symphony (formerly Folsom Symphony) is one of the Sacramento area's two other semi-pro orchestras, and has 5-10 musicians in common with Camellia Symphony at any given time.</li>

<ul>
<li>This is the only known symphony composed by a woman before 1800, and happens to be an excellent example of the Galant style that marked the transition from Baroque to Classical eras. Martines was the first woman in Europe to be admitted to professional music societies and was the only woman of the era to have compositions performed regularly by important ensembles. Most of her music was choral.</li>
<li>As a child, Martines lived in an apartment directly below Franz Joseph Haydn in Vienna, but her career as a composer did not benefit. At the time, Haydn was a struggling freelance pianist/organist, singer, and sometimes a street musician, just beginning to study composition himself. Haydn is known to have served as her accompanist in a number of vocal recitals, but that was the extent of their musical interaction during that period. The two composers' proximity is not much more than an interesting coincidence.</li>

<li>This symphony was originally dedicated to Napoleon, who Beethoven believed embodied the democratic ideals of the French Revolution. Napoleon crowned himself emperor, shortly after Beethoven completed the symphony, whereupon Beethoven angrily scratched out the dedication and re-dedicated it “to the memory of a great man.”</li>
<li>The “Eroica” Symphony is considered to mark the birth of the Romantic movement in music.</li>
<li>The second movement of this symphony has been frequently used as funeral music. It was played at the funerals of composer Felix Mendelssohn, US President Franklin D. Roosevelt, conductor Arturo Toscanini, and the eleven Israeli athletes killed in the 1972 Munich massacre, among others. The Boston Symphony Orchestra, in the middle of a concert when John F. Kennedy's assassination was reported, famously gave an impromptu performance of the second movement.</li>

<ul>
<li>Beethoven's 5th is, of course, the most-played and perhaps the most iconic orchestral piece of all, and the first thing many people think of when they hear the word "symphony."</li>
<li>This performance uses Beethoven's metronome marks, which are quite a bit faster than what many older listeners are used to. The metronome was invented during Beethoven's life, and he was the first composer to write precise metronome marks in his music. For much of the 20th century, conductors tended to play Beethoven much more slowly for dramatic effect, and assumed that Beethoven's metronome must have been defective. There has been a movement toward taking the metronome marks at face value, which has been controversial. The faster tempo requires a lighter touch on the strings and certainly changes the character of the piece.</li>

<ul>
<li>Though it is Beethoven's shortest symphony and one of his less-frequently-played symphonies, it was his personal favorite of the nine.</li>
<li>The two inner movements are believed to be musical jokes. (The symphony can be enjoyed without getting the jokes, but knowing the jokes adds to its depth!) The second movement is a good-natured parody of the metronome. The third movement goes back to the Classical-era minuet but this minuet is intentionally off-kilter.</li>

<ul>
<li>This is Beethoven's other iconic symphony (along with his 5th), though only his fourth most frequently performed in the US because of the number of performers required.</li>
<li>The second movement (scherzo) became extremely familiar to American audiences as the end credits music for <i>NBC Nightly News</i> for many years.</li>
<li>Beethoven's 9th is a popular New Year's tradition in Japan. In the early 20th century the German labor movement began a tradition of playing Beethoven's 9th on New Year's Eve, with performances timed so that the choral portion would begin at midnight. It was introduced to Japan during World War I by German prisoners of war, and from about 1926 onward the New Symphony Orchestra (Japan's first professional orchestra, now the NHK Symphony Orchestra) adopted the same tradition. Today, the New Year's tradition has waned in Germany, but became extremely widespread in Japan from the 1960s onward with virtually all the country's professional orchestras and many amateur orchestras performing Beethoven's 9th on New Year's Eve.</li>

<ul>
<li>This symphony is referred to as “Unfinished” because it has only two movements rather than the usual four. It is unclear whether Schubert considered this symphony to be complete; he also wrote a 30-measure fragment of a scherzo movement but appears to have abandoned that movement after only a few days.</li>
<li>In any case, contrary to what music appreciation classes often tell people, it was not Schubert's death that prevented him from continuing to work on this symphony; he lived six more years, and started and finished an entire additional symphony afterward.</li>

<p>Franz Schubert – Symphony No. 9 “Great”<br>
Mannheim Philharmonic Orchestra / Boian Videnoff<br>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jo74nDdmjoI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jo74nDdmjoI</a>
<ul>
<li>Schubert was clearly inspired to write a symphony on an epic scale by his friend and neighbor Beethoven. He begun work on this symphony the year after Beethoven's 9th was first performed, and even quoted fragments of the “Ode to Joy” in its final movement (e.g. 43:02 of video).</li>
<li>The nickname “Great” was originally adopted by a publisher because this was the longer of the two symphonies Schubert wrote in C major. The other, his 6th Symphony, became known as the “Little” C major symphony.</li>
<li>Both of the orchestras that rehearsed this symphony during Schubert's life canceled their planned performances because the last movement was too difficult for them, and two more attempted performances were similarly abandoned in 1829 and 1836. It was not performed until 1839, more than ten years after Schubert's death, by Felix Mendelssohn's Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra, then the leading orchestra in Europe. Even well into the 1840s, major orchestras in Vienna, Paris, and London canceled performances due to inability to play the symphony at an acceptable standard. It was not until the end of the 19th century, when orchestral playing standards had risen significantly, that Schubert's 9th Symphony became widely performed.</li>

<ul>
<li>Though titled as a symphony, <i>Symphonie Fantastique</i> is one of the earliest pieces of program music in the Romantic era, describing an artist's opium-induced visions.</li>
<li>Leonard Bernstein described this symphony as the beginning of psychedelia in music: "Berlioz tells it like it is. You take a trip, you wind up screaming at your own funeral."</li>

<ul>
<li>Farrenc was the first female composition student at the Paris Conservatory, and later the first female professor there. It was a highly prestigious position, but for a decade she was paid much less than her male colleagues. It was only in 1849, following the highly successful premieres of this symphony and her nonet, that she was able to demand and receive equal pay.</li>
<li>Though she was considered a first-rate composer by musicians of the time, she never gained widespread public recognition. Her gender was one of the main reasons, but not the only strike against her. The other was that she was almost purely an instrumental composer in opera-obsessed Paris and never wrote an opera; 19th century French composers who did not write opera tended to remain obscure.</li>

<ul>
<li>Niels Gade was Felix Mendelssohn's assistant conductor and then successor as music director of the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra, before going back to Copenhagen and founding the Royal Danish Academy of Music, where he taught almost every noteworthy Scandinavian composer of the second half of the 19th century.</li>
<li>How he got there is an interesting story in itself. Unable to get a performance of his first symphony in his native Copenhagen, 25-year-old Gade did the 19th century's equivalent of a cold call: he sent a copy of the score to Felix Mendelssohn with a letter asking for advice. Astoundingly, Europe's leading conductor replied to the unknown composer, suggesting no changes at all and instead offering to conduct the premiere in Leipzig. Mendelssohn followed through on the offer in March 1843 – and it was such a success that the Gewandhaus Orchestra performed the symphony again seven months later, this time with Gade himself appearing as a guest conductor. Not long after that, Gade became assistant conductor and was so highly regarded by his new mentor that he conducted the premiere of Mendelssohn's violin concerto.</li>

<ul>
<li>This was the first symphony by an American-born composer to be performed in Europe. Bristow was the concertmaster of of the New York Philharmonic from 1850 to 1853, before resigning over the Philharmonic's refusal to program more music by American composers. The French conductor Louis-Antoine Jullien, who was then touring the United States with his orchestra, hired Bristow as a violinist shortly afterward. Jullien was impressed by what he saw of Bristow's then-unfinished second symphony, and asked to be the first to perform it when it was completed. The symphony was first performed in Paris in 1856, and was also heard in England that year. Strangely, even though Bristow returned to New York after only one year with Jullien's orchestra, it was not performed in the United States until 2011.</li>

<ul>
<li>I would still regard this as an early Romantic symphony despite its relatively late date; late Romantic trends, while evident on the European continent as early as 1850, did not begin to take hold among British composers until the 1880s.</li>
<li>If you hear some resemblance in musical style between the last two movements and Gilbert & Sullivan operettas, it may be because they were contemporaries. This symphony was composed the year before the first Gilbert & Sullivan collaboration.</li>

<ul>
<li>Incredibly, the earliest Russian symphony to become widely performed in the West was one by a “Sunday composer” who had a busy regular job as a physician and one of the world's leading organic chemists. Many scientists recognize Borodin as a chemist and do not realize he was also a composer; many musicians recognize him as a composer and do not realize he was also a scientist. This symphony took Borodin seven years to complete, as “Sunday composer” was quite literal during that period of his life. His entire lifetime output was less than ten hours of music.</li>

<ul>
<li>Brahms did not complete his first symphony until he was 43 years old, which was somewhat surprising considering his level of fame by that time. Two things kept him from finishing a symphony for many years. First, he had been called the heir apparent to Beethoven's legacy, and he felt that he was expected to produce of symphony of appropriate gravitas to go with that reputation. Second, he was a notorious perfectionist, to the extent that he destroyed many of his early works. As a result, this first symphony took him 21 years to complete from first sketches to final product. Brahms was rather annoyed, for obvious reasons, when his symphony was hailed as Beethoven's Tenth.</li>
<li>The fourth movement contains one of Brahms's most famous melodies: a simple but grand C major theme reminiscent of Beethoven. It might be seen not only as a triumphant ending to the symphony, but as a celebration of Brahms's own exorcising of his symphonic demons.</li>

<ul>
<li>The inspiration for this symphony struck Nielsen when he stopped at a country inn for a beer and, while drinking, saw a comically bad painting of the Four Temperaments. He later wrote, “The Choleric was on horseback. He had a long sword in his hand, which he was wielding fiercely in thin air; his eyes were bulging out of his head, his hair streamed wildly around his face, which was so distorted by rage and diabolical hate that I could not help bursting out laughing. The other three pictures were in the same style, and my friends and I were heartily amused by the naivety of the pictures, their exaggerated expression and their comic earnestness.” In the symphony, each movement represents one of the Temperaments: choleric, phlegmatic, melancholic, and sanguine.</li>
<li>Nielsen's involvement in the first performance was not what one might expect for a composer: he played in his usual seat in the second violin section of the Royal Danish Orchestra!</li>

<ul>
<li>This symphony was composed in 1916, in the midst of the First World War, and contains what seems to be musical depictions of trench warfare and artillery barrages. Nielsen wrote that the title refers to "the elemental will to live"; the symphony expressed both Nielsen's horror at civilization's self-destruction and his faith that humanity would survive and rebuild.</li>

<ul>
<li>Both Tchaikovsky and Rachmaninoff regarded Kalinnikov as the most talented composer in Russia at the time of his death, but his career was tragically short as he both started late and died young. Kalinnikov turned to composition only after tuberculosis forced him to stop performing as a bassoonist, so virtually all of his music was written during his terminal illness.</li></ul>

<p>Charles Ives (1874-1954, USA) – Symphony No. 2<br>

<ul>
<li>For most of his life Charles Ives was known mainly as an insurance executive (he founded the company now known as Mutual of New York), and secondarily as chairman of the organizing committee for Ivy League sports. Few of his business peers were aware that he composed music. He abruptly ceased composing in 1927 after suffering several heart attacks, several years before he retired from the insurance business. Virtually none of his music was performed before the 1930s, and most of his music was not performed until after his death. His 2nd Symphony, completed in 1909, received its first performance in 1951. Ives, who heard the performance on the radio, is said to have been amazed to hear applause at the end of the symphony.</li>
<li>Ives's musical style might be described as “Americana in a blender.” As a child in Danbury, Connecticut, he had especially enjoyed sitting in the center of the town square on holidays, where he could hear several bands playing simultaneously. This effect was a major influence on his music, in which he often quoted popular songs and layered them on top of one another.</li>

<li>In 1928, on the occasion of the 100th anniversary of Franz Schubert's death, the Columbia Gramophone Company sponsored an international symphony competition in which composers were to write a symphony inspired by Schubert and using similar orchestral forces to what would have been commonly seen in Schubert's time. Though a number of well-known composers entered the competition, the winner of the $10,000 first prize was an amateur composer named Kurt Atterberg who held a full-time job in the Swedish patent office. Atterberg's winning symphony gained the nickname “Dollar Symphony.” Despite his new-found wealth and fame, Atterberg continued to work at the patent office until he was forced, under great protest,into retirement at the age of 81.</li>
<li>When he was much younger, Atterberg may have one of the most astounding late-starting string players in music history. Inspired by a concert he attended, he began cello lessons at 15 with no prior musical training whatsoever. Just six years later, he successfully auditioned for a seat in the Royal Stockholm Philharmonic while he was a full-time engineering student. After he received his engineering degree, he spent a year studying music and performing as a professional cellist before resuming his technical career as a patent examiner.</li>

<p>Dmitry Shostakovich (1906-1975, Russia) – Symphony No. 5<br>
BBC Symphony Orchestra / Valery Gergiev<br>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTqsU7tQW48">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTqsU7tQW48</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Shostakovich subtitled this symphony "A Soviet artist's creative response to just criticism," referring to Stalin's denunciation of his recent opera <i>Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District</i> and the forced cancellation of his 4th Symphony's premiere. All this took place at the height of Stalin's purges. Shostakovich feared for his life, especially after the high-ranking Red Army general who had been protecting him was himself arrested on trumped-up charges and executed. Shostakovich's "creative response" was a symphony that was more conservative in harmonic language so as to get back into Stalin's good graces, but filled with sarcastic gestures that audiences recognized as a protest: a goose-stepping march in the first movement, a parody of a waltz in the second movement, a third movement echoing the Russian Orthodox requiem, and "forced rejoicing" at the end of the fourth movement as the strings hammer on the same chord 252 times in a row.</li>
<li>A description of the end of the symphony, attributed to Shostakovich himself: "The rejoicing is forced, created under threat, as in <i>Boris Godunov</i>. It's as if someone were beating you with a stick and saying, 'Your business is rejoicing, your business is rejoicing,' and you rise, shaky, and go marching off, muttering, 'Our business is rejoicing, our business is rejoicing.'"</li>

<li>This was a piece intended for a young audience, as the movements' whimsical alliterative titles might suggest. Britten composed this short symphony for string orchestra while he was an undergraduate student, using melodies taken from some of his earliest childhood compositions.</li>

<li>Very little biographical information is available on Sheng, probably because he spent the majority of his career working in composing collectives for the Communist Chinese government. He is mainly known as one of six composers whose names appear on the <i>Yellow River Piano Concerto</i>. Sheng's <i>Ocean Symphony</i> is one of only two pieces from his entire career that were published under his name alone, both composed in the 1980s after artists were allowed to depart from the previously mandatory “socialist realism.”</li>
