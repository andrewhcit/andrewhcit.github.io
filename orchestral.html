<p>This is a selection of pieces that Alfie might enjoy listening to. I've included most of the iconic pieces in the classical repertoire and most of the pieces used in popular cartoons or other pop culture (as long as they seem enjoyable throughout for someone new to classical music), added a few personal favorites and other pieces I think are accessible, and tried to sprinkle in some diversity in composers because I don't want it to be limited to dead white men from just six European countries.</p>
<p>I decided to select videos that show the musicians in live performance as long as I could find at least one with both reasonable performance quality and audiovisual recording quality. I considered recording quality at least as important as performance quality in selecting videos; I also tried to limit the amount of non-musical material in the videos (e.g. generally avoiding videos that include over 90 seconds of applause at the end).</p>

<ul>
<li>Yes, this is being played by a “baroque” orchestra, but it would be more accurate to call Apollo's Fire a period instrument orchestra. String players switched from the baroque bow to the modern Tourte bow beginning in the 1760s, but the instruments remained the same for some time longer. The A to which musicians tuned began to rise in the late 18th century, the chin rest was introduced in the early 19th century, and the shoulder rest appeared later still.</li>

<li>Beethoven's three Leonore Overtures were all draft overtures intended for his only opera <i>Fidelio</i>, whose working title was <i>Leonore</i>. All three were discarded but were eventually published separately. Leonore Overture No. 3 is the most popular of the four overtures for stand-alone performances in the concert hall – Beethoven ended up rejecting it because he was afraid it would overshadow the opera itself!</li>

<ul>
<li>Although the opera is not often performed outside Russia, its overture is famous as an orchestral showpiece, frequently used to display the virtuosity of an orchestra's string sections.</li>
<li>The conductor of this performance, Valery Gergiev, famously (or infamously) tended to lose batons early in his conducting career as he would lose his grip and accidentally throw them in the air while conducting vigorously. From his early 30s onward, he has usually used a toothpick as a baton.</li>

<ul>
<li>Before steam engines became commonplace, a calm sea was not a good thing! This piece, inspired by a pair of Goethe poems, takes the listener from the anxiety of the becalmed sailor to relief as the wind picks up, and reaches its destination.</li>

<p>Otto Nicolai (1810-1849, Germany) – Overture to <i>The Merry Wives of Windsor</i><br>
Victoria Symphony Orchestra / Darryl One<br>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F9ZuBKDCzY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F9ZuBKDCzY</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Nicolai was a well-known conductor, and is best known as the Vienna Philharmonic's first-ever conductor. However, his opera <i>The Merry Wives of Windsor</i> was his first and last major success as a composer; he died suddenly of a stroke two months after its premiere. It turns out he could have gotten his big break earlier, but ended up becoming a footnote in opera history instead: in 1841 he turned down an opera libretto that was then offered to a then-unknown Giuseppe Verdi and became <i>Nabucco</i>, the opera that first made Verdi famous.</li>

<li>I'm reluctant to include this because it's the traditional finals week wake-up call at Caltech. It's also a Caltech tradition that anyone who plays it outside finals week, except when marathoning the entire Ring Cycle, gets thrown into the nearest pond. But it's also an iconic piece, so it's included here.</li>

<ul>
<li>Offenbach's comic opera <i>Orphée aux enfers</i> (Orpheus in the Underworld) is an irreverent, satirical take on the Orpheus story that skewers Gluck's opera <i>Orfeo ed Euridice</i>, stilted performances of classical drama, and various society and political scandals of the day. Today, it is best known outside classical circles as the origin of the “can-can,” which occurs in the second act of the opera and is also heard near the end of the overture.</li>

<ul>
<li>Borodin left his opera <i>Prince Igor</i> unfinished when he suddenly and unexpectedly died of a ruptured aortic aneurysm, and it was completed using his notes by his colleagues Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov and Alexander Glazunov. The overture is one of the greatest feats of musical memory in Western music history, as Borodin had it fully formed in his mind but had written down only a small portion of it. Two weeks before his death, Borodin had informally presented the overture to Rimsky-Korsakov and Glazunov for feedback, playing it on the piano and stopping at many points to describe the orchestration. At the time, of course, neither of the guests would have had any reason to consciously try to remember the overture, and neither heard the overture again after that day – and yet Glazunov reconstructed it in its entirety, his reconstruction being consistent with all the parts that Rimsky-Korsakov remembered.</li>
<li>Rimsky-Korsakov and Glazunov did most of the work to complete the opera at Borodin's kitchen table, with the constant distraction of the deceased composer's six cats.</li>

<ul>
<li>This was Brahms's famous musical joke. Brahms was nominated for an honorary doctorate at the University of Breslau, and accepted it, thinking he would not have to do more than give a few remarks on the occasion. Upon learning that he was expected to compose a piece of music for the occasion, Brahms decided to take a jab at the university by composing an overture based on student drinking songs that were popular at the time.</li>
<li>Elmer Bernstein used this piece for his own musical joke in the soundtrack of <i>Animal House</i>: some of the music heard during the title sequence is taken from the Academic Festival Overture, with the same orchestration and only slight changes to the notes. Ironically, the statue of the college's founder appears on screen to the backdrop of an orchestrated drinking song!</li>

<ul>
<li>It turns out the theme was not by Haydn at all! Brahms was intrigued after finding a piece titled “Chorale St. Antoni,” which unbeknownst to Brahms was spuriously attributed to Haydn by the publisher. Accordingly, some recordings and concert programs now refer to the piece as the “St. Anthony Variations.”</li>

<li>I've picked a performance that uses muskets instead of cannons, so as to avoid excessively frightening the cats – but this might be closer to what Tchaikovsky heard! Because it was virtually impossible in the 19th century to time the cannon shots with enough precision, it wasn't until 1967 that cannons were actually used in a performance. All the documented performances before then used either small arms, simulated cannon fire, or recorded cannon sounds.</li>

<li><i>Capriccio Italien</i> was Tchaikovsky's musical travelogue of a vacation in Rome during Carnival. It follows his visit in extremely literal detail, beginning with a bugle call because he stayed at a hotel next door to a military barracks! The rest of the music, though, is mostly inspired by street bands Tchaikovsky heard.</li>
