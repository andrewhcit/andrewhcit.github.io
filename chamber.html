<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZI2q4bm-OU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZI2q4bm-OU</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Beethoven gave this short duo its unusual title as a humorous jab at the nearsighted cellist friend for whom he wrote the duo. Beethoven was an excellent violist (he had made a living playing the viola in orchestras before he became famous as a pianist and composer) and likely wrote the viola part for himself to play.</li>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W83hC5uOLRY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W83hC5uOLRY</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Rossini's six string sonatas, for the unusual quartet of two violins, cello, and double bass, are his first compositions, written when he was 12 years old. What makes the young Rossini so remarkable is that he had minimal musical training at the time: his first music lessons were not until he was 10.</li>
<li>There is no truth, however, to Rossini's later claim to have composed all six of his string sonatas in the space of three days. Rossini was notoriously prone to self-aggrandizement.</li></ul>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JTH4ZdJcjk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JTH4ZdJcjk</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Mendelssohn's Octet, composed when he was 16, was his first major success and its remarkable maturity is the reason he is considered by some to have been a greater prodigy than Mozart.</li>
<li>Mendelssohn was the conductor who brought Bach out of obscurity. This was still years in the future when he composed his Octet, but his lifelong interest in the Baroque era is evident in the fourth movement, which directly quotes a melody from the Hallelujah Chorus in Handel's Messiah.</li>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdC5nPoNVk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdC5nPoNVk</a></p>
<ul>
<li>By 1887, the newly-famous Dvorak had quit his jobs as a professional orchestral violist to focus on composition, but was still earning extra money by renting out a room in his house to lodgers. In January of that year, he was delighted to learn that the university student about to move in was an amateur violinist. He composed his Terzetto in a few days, intending to play it with his new lodger and one of his former National Theatra Orchestra colleagues on the two violin parts. The music proved to be too difficult for the young student, so Dvorak wrote an easier set of miniatures for the same instruments. The Terzetto, meanwhile, was published two months later and entered the standard chamber music repertoire almost immediately.</li>

<ul>
<li>Laura Valborg Aulin's brother, Tor Aulin, was the founder of one of Europe's first full-time professional string quartets touring as a permanent ensemble. As a result, unusually for a woman composer of the era, her two string quartets were performed all over Europe. They fell into obscurity quite abruptly while she was still alive: after Tor Aulin's quartet disbanded in 1912 and was no longer actively promoting her music, performances of Laura Valborg Aulin's string quartets ceased before the end of the year and they were not heard again until 1991.</li>

<p>Anton Arensky (1861-1906, Russia) – String Quartet No. 2<br>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8LMfvhhahc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8LMfvhhahc</a></p>
<ul>
<li>This quartet bears the inscription “To the memory of Tchaikovsky,” and Arensky used an unusual inverted quartet of one violin, one viola, and two cellos to create the deep sonorities he thought necessary for this homage to the recently-deceased giant of Russian music. The second movement is a set of variations on a theme by Tchaikovsky.</li>

<ul>
<li>This piece comes from one of the Danish String Quartet's two folk crossover albums. Products of the internet era, these albums are the result of a crowdfunded trip through Northern Europe in which the quartet recorded and arranged local folk songs for string quartet.</li>
<li><i>Shine You No More</i> is one of the few original pieces from the two albums, rather than a folk song. Composed by the quartet's first violinist Rune Tonsgaard Sørensen, it is an Irish reel based loosely on a song by English Renaissance composer John Dowland.</li>

<ul>
<li>Anton Reicha was a lifelong friend of Beethoven; the two met as teenagers playing in the Bonn orchestra under the direction of Reicha's uncle. They took different paths, though: Reicha, after composing several unsuccessful operas, devoted his life mainly to teaching and is remembered as one of the greatest composition teachers of the 19th century. His students included Franz Liszt, Hector Berlioz, Charles Gounod, Louise Farrenc, and Cesar Franck; Frederic Chopin also looked to him for advice at times.</li>
<li>The other thing Reicha is remembered for is popularizing the wind quintet. Though he was not the first to compose for that ensemble, his 25 wind quintets more than doubled the extant wind quintet literature.</li>

<li>This short piece for piano trio was composed as a gift for a friend's ten-year-old daughter, to encourage her in her piano playing.

<ul>
<li>This piece is referred to as the “Archduke” trio because it was composed for Archduke Rudolph of Austria, who was not only a patron but also a piano student of Beethoven, and evidently a virtuoso pianist considering the difficulty of the pieces Beethoven wrote for him. However, the first performance was with the composer himself at the piano. By then Beethoven had lost most of his hearing and played poorly.

<ul>
<li>This trio has two dates on it. It was Brahms's first piece of chamber music to be published and performed, when he was 20 years old and still composing under the pseudonym “Johannes Kreisler, Jr.,” and heavily revised in 1889 with as much as a third of the original score deleted and replaced. It is the only later-revised Brahms piece for which the original version survives.</li>
<li>For most of the 19th century, music by leading European composers often waited a decade or longer before being performed in the New World. Remarkably, the original version of this trio had its <i>first</i> public performance in the United States. The American pianist William Mason received an early copy of the score while studying in Europe and performed the trio in New York shortly after his return to the United States in 1855.</li>

<li>Dvořák composed his Bagatelles for a small informal chamber music concert at a friend's home. Dvořák performed the piece with the members of his usual string quartet; he normally played the viola, but chose to write a keyboard part for himself instead. The host did not own a piano, but was able to find a portable harmonium (reed organ) for Dvořák to play. Thus the unusual instrumentation was dictated by the people and place involved.</li>

<li>Ernő Dohnányi (also known as Ernst von Dohnanyi) made a giant splash with his first published piece, this piano quintet composed when he was 18 years old. However, Dohnanyi was overshadowed as a composer by his Hungarian contemporaries Bartók and Kodály largely because he was a mainstream late Romantic composer rather than a nationalist. He was known mainly as a leading conductor during his life, and is probably best known today as the grandfather of conductor Christoph von Dohnanyi (Cleveland Orchestra) and German politician Klaus von Dohnanyi (former West German Minister of Education and mayor of Hamburg).</li>

The arpeggione had a cello-like body and was played with a bow, but it had six strings tuned to the same notes as a guitar and its fingerboard had frets. Fewer than a hundred arpeggiones have ever been made, most of them since 1980.</li>

<ul>
<li>A young Johannes Brahms composed this scherzo as his contribution to the “F-A-E Sonata,” a collaboration between him, Robert Schumann, and Schumann's student Albert Dietrich. The sonata was a gift to violinist Joseph Joachim, a friend of all three composers. Because Joachim used the Romantic German phrase “Frei aber einsam” (free but lonely) as a personal motto, the composers based each movement on the sequence of notes F-A-E. The complete piece was presented to Joachim and performed privately, but not published or performed in public until 1935, long after all three composers and Joachim had died. The two movements Schumann composed were eventually incorporated into his Violin Sonata No. 3, Brahms's movement was published as a stand-alone piece, and Dietrich never reused or published his movement separately from the F-A-E Sonata.</li>

<ul>
<li>This sonata, one of my favorites, is closely connected with Brahms's third violin sonata. Maier became part of Brahms's social circle while a student of violin and composition in Leipzig, and Brahms considered her to be a first-rate composer. Maier's violin sonata and Brahms's third violin sonata were begun around the same time, and both were composed slowly over a period of years with the two composers exchanging drafts for feedback. Both sonatas were eventually performed in Amsterdam with Maier on violin and Brahms on piano. After Maier died of tuberculosis at a relatively young age, her music was largely forgotten and this sonata is believed to have gone 100 years (1894-1994) between performances.</li>

<p>Rebecca Clarke (1886-1979, England/USA) – Viola Sonata +<br>

<ul>
<li>Rebecca Clarke is obscure to the general public, but virtually all violists know her name; one of the reasons for her obscurity is that so much of her music featured solo viola! She was one of the first six women to play in a major professional orchestra when the Queen's Hall Orchestra opened auditions to women in 1912; four years later she moved to the United States (already a citizen through her American father) and became America's first full-time touring viola soloist just as the viola was beginning to come into its own as a solo instrument.</li>
<li>Clarke's viola sonata tied for first prize in an international competition in 1919, but fell into obscurity after Clarke retired from performing in the 1940s. It was revived beginning in the 1970s while she was still alive. Since 1990, it has been the single most performed piece for solo viola, making the viola unique among the instruments of the orchestra in having its most-performed solo work composed by a woman.</li>
